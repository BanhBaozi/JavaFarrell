//orderNumber - of type int
//size - of type String

//Create set methods for the order number, size, and color and get methods for all four fields. The price is determined by the size: $22.99 for XXL or XXXL, and $19.99 for all other sizes.

//Create a subclass named CustomTee that descends from TeeShirt and includes a field named slogan (of type String) to hold the slogan requested for the shirt, and include get and set methods for this field.
