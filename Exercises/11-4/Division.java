//Create an abstract Division class with fields for a companyâ€™s division name and account number, and an abstract display() method. Use a constructor in the superclass that requires values for both fields. Create two subclasses named InternationalDivision and DomesticDivision. The InternationalDivision includes a field for the country in which the division is located and a field for the language spoken; its constructor requires both. The DomesticDivision includes a field for the state in which the division is located; a value for this field is required by the constructor.

public abstract class Division
{
    protected String divisionTitle;
    protected int acctNum;
    public Division(String title, int acct)
    {
        divisionTitle = title;
        acctNum = acct;
    }
    public abstract void display();
}
